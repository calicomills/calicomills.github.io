Education
 
National Institute of Technology(NIT), Karnataka Surathkal, Karnataka
B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering; CGPA: 7.14 

Experience
 
Synopsys India Pvt. Ltd. Bengaluru ,Karnataka
R and D Engineer I Feb 2021 - Present
  Web Application using Django: Implemented a scalable web application from scratch to dynamically keep
track of performance metrics of successive software versions using the Django Web Framework and Python. Used
HTML,CSS,Javascript to create an easy to use interface and made use of a PostgreSQL Database.
  Automated Job submission and Log Parser: Built a distributed Job Submission system to trigger daily and
weekly regression runs. It employs a multi-threaded approach to track the runs to completion. On successful
completion, the logs of the individual runs are parsed and data collected is stored to a PostgreSQL DB.
  Auto-Triangulation System: Built a distributed Triangulation system to  nd out software changes which caused
performance degradation between two successive Software versions and also connected it to a Web interface to
create 
ags for the identi ed culprit changes.Used the multiprocessing module in Python to achieve parallelism.
